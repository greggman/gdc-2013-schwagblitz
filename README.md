GDC 2013 SchwagBlitz
====================

You are an indie game developer at GDC running around the expo floor
handing out flyers for your new game. The people that leave the expo
with your flyer the better your game will sell.

*   Hand out flyers by passing expo attendies

*   Remove trashcans so attendies don't throw them away

*   Block passages to direct attendies to the exit
